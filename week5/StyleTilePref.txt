For my website I chose to go with a more traditional layout, my style tile 1. The tabs are on the top, my
picture is on the leftside of the page while the rest of the content is on the rightside of the page. 
This layout made sense for the website I'm creating, it allows me to organize the content and to put an 
emphasis on the content I deem more important. The style tile gives enough structure and layed out the
website components out well enough, that a comp isn't necessarily needed. This more traditional style 
tile allowed me to play around with the padding/sizing and quickly make the best decision for how I'd 
like the website to look.
